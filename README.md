# Routing-and-Middleware-Exercise
For this exercise we will be building a simple JSON API application where we will store a shopping list. You should use an array to store your items in the shopping list.

Each item should be a JavaScript object with the keys of name, and price.

Remember that since you are using an array for storage, this will be cleared each time the server restarts. Create a simple file called fakeDb.js which contains the following:

global.items = []

module.exports = items

Use this list of items in your routes and test files.

Your application should have the following routes:

GET /items - this should render a list of shopping items.

Here is what a response looks like:

[{“name”: “popsicle”, “price”: 1.45}, {“name”:”cheerios”, “price”: 3.40}]

POST /items - this route should accept JSON data and add it to the shopping list.

Here is what a sample request/response looks like:

{“name”:”popsicle”, “price”: 1.45} => {“added”: {“name”: “popsicle”, “price”: 1.45}}

GET /items/:name - this route should display a single item’s name and price.

Here is what a sample response looks like:

{“name”: “popsicle”, “price”: 1.45}

PATCH /items/:name, this route should modify a single item’s name and/or price.

Here is what a sample request/response looks like:

{“name”:”new popsicle”, “price”: 2.45} => {“updated”: {“name”: “new popsicle”, “price”: 2.45}}

DELETE /items/:name - this route should allow you to delete a specific item from the array.

Here is what a sample response looks like:

{message: “Deleted”}

Please make use of the Express Router.
